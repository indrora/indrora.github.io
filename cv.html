<a name="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h1>

<p>In any line of work, I aim to bring my skills in a diverse skill set to a team, helping build solutions and deliver on-time. In any of my positions, I aim to fulfill these basic goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>As an IT professional</em>, to find solutions to IT problems that often don't have clear answers, working inside a team to produce results.</li>
  <li><em>As a System Adminstrator</em>, to build and maintain systems that work more reliably than the passing of time.</li>
  <li><em>As a software developer</em>, to write code that makes diamonds look soft, lets grandma build rockets and monkeys write literature.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="projects" class="anhor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h1>

<p>I maintain a small selection of projects. Listed are some of my most commonly seen:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="/Atomic/">Atomic</a>: an IRC client for Android forked from yaaic</li>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/indrora/mill-laser-print/">Mill-Laser-Print</a>: A selection of CAD models, drawings, etc. that I've used or made for my local hackerspace. </li>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/indrora/neural/">Neural</a>: A mod of the Neural Network Live Wallpaper for Android. An experiment in learning RenderScript, Android's GPU-computation platform.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/indrora/frmwrk">Frmwrk</a>: A PHP framework for people on a <strike>absinthe</strike> Haskell binge. </li>
	<li> I keep my <a href=https://bitbucket.org/indrora/dotfiles">configuration dot-files</a> in a Git repo. It's a fun thing to do, and keeps me thinking about configuration management.</li>
</ul>
<p> Some of these are maintained more than others. Due to my schooling, they often get placed on the wayside. My primary project, Atomic, has even been given a little note of neatness from the original author.</p>

<h1><a name="knowledge" class="anchor" href="#knowledge"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Knowledge base</h1>

<p>I have worked to maintain a wide knowledge base that extends deeper in some places than others. A selection of what I have done in
the past includes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cisco network hardware administration;</li>
  <li>Windows XP-8/Server 2003-2012 administration;</li>
  <li>Linux, BSD and embedded administration;</li>

</ul>

contributing to a variety of codebases and a variety of project styles.</p>
